Comparative study of onshore vs. offshore wind energy in the Netherlands, analyzing efficiency, costs, and environmental impacts using data from official sources such as RVO, IEA, and EU reports.

🌍 Offshore vs Onshore Wind Energy in the Netherlands

 📌 About
This project is a comparative study of **offshore (sea-based)** and **onshore (land-based)** wind energy in the Netherlands.  
It explores **efficiency, costs, and environmental impacts** using data from official sources such as RVO, IEA, and EU reports.

 🎯 Objectives
- Compare energy production efficiency  
- Evaluate installation and maintenance costs  
- Assess environmental and social impacts  
- Understand each modality’s role in the Dutch energy transition  

 📊 Methodology
- Data collection from **official institutions**  
- Data cleaning & preparation with Python  
- Statistical and visual analysis  
- Results presented in **graphs, tables, and reports**  

 🗂 Repository Structure
- `data/` → Official datasets  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with analysis  
- `visualizations/` → Charts and dashboards  
- `docs/` → Reports and references  

 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  

 📈 Results (Preview)
- Offshore wind shows higher **capacity factor**, but installation and maintenance are more expensive  
- Onshore wind is more affordable but less efficient  
- Both play a crucial role in Dutch **sustainability and decarbonization goals**
