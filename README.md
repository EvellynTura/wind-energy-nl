üå± SUSTAINABLE WIND ENERGY IN THE NETHERLANDS:

The Netherlands is one of the leading countries in the transition to renewable energy, with a strong focus on wind power, both onshore and offshore.
This project analyzes data on the capacity factor (efficiency) and the cost evolution of wind energy generation in the country between 2018 and 2022.

‚ö° EFFICIENCY COMPARISON: Onshore vs Offshore

The capacity factor measures how efficiently a turbine generates electricity compared to its maximum potential.
The chart below shows that offshore wind farms consistently perform better than onshore, reaching capacity factors of around 42‚Äì44%, while onshore farms remain closer to 28‚Äì32%.

‚û°Ô∏è This highlights the strong potential of offshore wind energy, taking advantage of stronger and more stable winds in the North Sea.

üí∂ COST EVOLUTION:

The analysis of cost per MWh shows a downward trend for both types of generation:

Onshore: decreased from ~‚Ç¨60 to ‚Ç¨55/MWh between 2018 and 2022.

Offshore: decreased from ~‚Ç¨90 to ‚Ç¨84/MWh over the same period.

‚û°Ô∏è Although offshore projects remain more expensive, the downward trend shows that the technology is becoming increasingly competitive.

CONCLUSION:
The Netherlands is moving towards a cleaner energy mix, with offshore wind playing a key role.
Higher efficiency and falling costs reinforce the strategic importance of wind power in achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

üìä This repository demonstrates, through Python data analysis and visualizations, how to tell a compelling data-driven story about sustainable energy.
